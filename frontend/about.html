    <h2>About SoilSense</h2>

    <p>
        SoilSense is an intelligent soil health analysis platform developed as part of the
        CivoraX Internship Programme. The project focuses on transforming raw soil parameter
        data into meaningful insights that support sustainable agricultural practices.
    </p>

    <p>
        The system evaluates essential soil parameters such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus,
        Potassium, pH, and moisture levels to determine overall soil condition.
        Based on this analysis, users receive clear health classifications and advisory suggestions.
    </p>

    <p>
        SoilSense currently uses rule-based decision logic and is architected to support
        future integration of machine learning models for predictive soil health analysis,
        crop suitability recommendations, and smart irrigation advisory systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project emphasizes clean design, clarity, and scalability, laying a strong
        foundation for advanced agricultural intelligence solutions.
