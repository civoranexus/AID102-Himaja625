# SoilSense - Intelligent Soil Health Analysis

SoilSense is a project that uses intelligence and machine learning to understand and look at
the soil. The project is really, about figuring out what is going on with the soil. 
SoilSense is trying to make sense of the soil by using intelligence and machine learning to 
analyze it.

Soil health is very important. We can tell how healthy the soil is by using key parameters.
These parameters include things like Nitrogen and Phosphorus. We often see Nitrogen referred 
to as N and Phosphorus as P. Soil health depends on a lot of things including Nitrogen and
Phosphorus levels. We need to check the levels of Potassium (K), pH, moisture levels,
Nitrogen and Phosphorus, in the soil to see if it is healthy. 

The main idea of this project is to figure out the condition of the soil health. This
project is about understanding the soil health conditions. The goal is to classify the soil
health conditions so we can see what shape the soil is in. The project is focused on the
soil health conditions and how to classify them.

We can learn a lot from the soil data. Get some really useful information that can help us
make better decisions about the soil. This information, from the soil data is very
important. It can support better things. The soil data can give us insights that can support
better ways of doing things and better agricultural decision-making.

This project is being worked on as part of the CivoraX Internship Programme. The CivoraX
Internship Programme is what this project is a part of (AIML domain). The initial focus is 
on learning, data understanding, and building the solution step by step in a structured
manner.
