# SoilSense - Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Understanding the Problem and Data

- Study the various indicators which determine soil health together with their importance in environmental assessment

- Researchers need to examine all soil data which exists in the current database

- Perform basic data cleaning and visualization

## Phase 2: Model Building and Evaluation

- The project needs machine learning classification methods which work best for its specific requirements

- The evaluation of model performance requires suitable evaluation metrics

- The results will improve through better comprehension of the features in the data

## Phase 3: Insights and Documentation

- Develop useful interpretations from model output data

- Record all discovered information, together with the knowledge which was acquired during the process

- The project needs to receive its last review before getting ready for the presentation stage
