**Soil Health Parameters - SoilSense**

Soil health is an underlying factor that affects crop development, productivity, and long-term agricultural sustainability. In the SoilSense project, soil health is assessed by sampling and analyzing key physical and chemical characteristics
that directly affect plant development.

This document discusses the main soil parameters SoilSense takes into account and why they matter for smart soil health analysis.

**Nitrogen (N):**

Nitrogen is among one of the most crucial nutrients for plants.
It is key to leaf development and plant vigor.
- Low nitrogen causes stunted growth and yellow leaves.
- Too much nitrogen can unbalance soil and impact crop quality.
In SoilSense, nitrogen numbers assist in deciding if the ground is fit for wholesome crops to grow in or need fertility administration.

**Phosphorus (P):**

Phosphorus plays a vital role in root development, blooming and seed production.
It facilitates energy transfer in plants and bolsters initial growth.
Phosphorus deficient crops will have decreased yield and root strength.
- Surplus phosphorus could cause nutrient imbalance in soil.
SoilSense employs phosphorus to measure root health potential and recommend corrective measures if required.

**Potassium (K):**

Potassium promotes general plant vigor, disease resistance,
and water regulation within crops.
- Low potassium can make plants lanky and susceptible to diseases.
- Sufficient potassium enhances crop quality and stress resistance.
Potassium levels are used in SoilSense to assess stress tolerance and long-term soil productivity.

**Soil pH:**

Soil pH is the acidity or alkalinity of the soil.
It immediately impacts nutrient uptake of plants.
- Super low or high pH will inhibit nutrient absorption.
- The majority of crops require a certain range of pH.
SoilSense takes into account soil pH to assess nutrient availability and identify potential soil treatment requirements.

**Moisture Level:**

Soil moisture is the water available to crops.
It’s a critical part of nutrient transport and plant metabolism.
- Dryness can strain plants and decrease production.
- Over watering can cause root rot and leeching of nutrients.
Moisture levels are also evaluated in SoilSense and overall soil condition.

**Summary:**

By studying Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH and moisture collectively,
SoilSense seeks to deliver a robust and relevant soil health score.
These are the variables that give rise to the training data used in subsequent machine
learning analysis and intelligent soil health recommendations.
